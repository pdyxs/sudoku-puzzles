Skyscrapers: Digits in the grid represent skyscrapers, with their values corresponding to their heights. Taller skyscrapers obscure all shorter skyscrapers behind them. Clues outside the grid indicate the number of skyscrapers that can be seen in that row/column, from the line of sight of the clue.

X-Sums: Clues outside the grid indicate the sum of the first N digits, where N is the digit in the closest cell to the clue.

Unknown clues: A box outside the grid indicates that the skyscraper and x-sums clue there is the same.  Each box can have a different value.

Renban Lines: Digits on a purple line form a set of non-repeating, consecutive digits in any order.

Grey lines are purely cosmetic
