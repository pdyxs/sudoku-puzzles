1. By looking at the possible values of X-sums and Skyscrapers, you can determine that the only possible clue values are 3, 5 and 6, and the only possible values of X are 2 and 3
1. r12c1 are a 23 pair, but if r2c1 was a 3, it'd need a 2 on it's sum (in box 1). This resolves r123c1 as 321, r1c5 as 2 and r2c2 as 4 (as the only remaining viable sum is 6)
1. Because r9c34 are a 23 pair, one of them is a 3 and so must have a 12 pair above it in r8. Therefore r8c9 cannot be a 3, as it would require a 12 pair in r8c78.
1. In c1,  there's only 1 cell leeway. So r4c1 is 45 and r4c2 is 456. But if r9c3 was a 3, you'd need to also fulfil a skyscraper of 6 in c3 (from the bottom), and r56c3 would also be from 456. As such, r9c3 is a 2.
1. r789c4 are now disambiguated as 213, and r8c38 are a 34 pair
1. In c4, the 8 must be in r123 and the 9 in r12 to fulfil the 6 skyscraper. But r2c4 cannot be 8 or 9, or it breaks the r2 skyscraper. So r3c4 is 8 and r1c4 is 9.
1. r654c4 is now a virtual thermo, and the only place for a 4 in the column is r6c4
1. r2c3 is 56 because of the r2 skyscraper. Because 9 cannot be in r1c3, the maximum skyscraper length in c3 is 7. But if r8c3 is 4, both 1 and 3 are forced into r4-7c3, making the maximum skyscraper length 5. So r8c3 must be 3.
1. The renban in r8 must be from 5678 (since 9 would invalidate the skyscraper in r8). Because of the skyscraper in c1, both 8 and 9 in c1 must be in b7. As such, one of 8 or 9 is forced onto the renban, meaning that it's now from 678. Because of the skyscraper, they must increase from right to left. r8c1 is now 9, and r8c2 is 5.
1. r1c4-7 is now a virtual thermo going downwards, making r7c1 either 7 or 8. Now the renban in r7c23 must be 67, and the rest of b7 and all of c1 can be filled.
1. Now the renban in r5c234 must be 345 (in that order)
1. The only valid place for 9 in c3 (to allow the skyscraper to work) is r3c3, leaving a 18 pair in c2 and placing 8 in r1c2.
1. The renban in r6 must be a 123 triple, resolving b4
1. The renban in r3 must be 234 (since 2 is placed in r3 in b3), placing 4 in r1c6 and then in r7c5. This in turn makes the renban in r1 from 567, making a triple with r1c3 and setting r1c7 to 1
1. r4c5 is 7 (because of the renban with r4c4), unwinding the 67 pair in c4. For the r2 skyscraper to work, the renban in r2c89 must be 89 (in that order)
1. r3c5 being 56 and r4c5 being 7 makes it impossible for r2c5 to be 1, as the minimum skyscraper value would be 4.
1. The renban in r9 must be from 56789, with 6 being in r9c6, and r9c5 being 5 or 9. But if it was 9, the skyscraper value for c5 would be too high, so it must be 5. Boxes 1, 2, 4, 7 and 8 can now be finished
1. In r5, once you've filled in the 9 in c5, the only valid fills for the renban in c78 are 21 or 87 (in those orders). r5c6 is either 2 or 8, creating a 28 pair with r5c7, and making r5c89 a 17 pair.
1. There's now an x-wing on 7's in r1c89 and r5c89, setting r9c7 as 7. 3 is the only possible fill of r7c7, and the rest of the puzzle should be solvable from there.
