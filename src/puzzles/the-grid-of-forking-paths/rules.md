Sudoku: Fill the grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Kropki: If there is a white dot between two digits, one digit must be one more than the other. If there is a black dot between two digits, one digit must be twice the other.

Rooms: The grid is divided into rooms, each of which is shaded in a different colour.

Doors: Kropki dots act as doors between rooms. Complete the room you're in and the digits on either side of a door to open a new door.

Diverging paths: At the start of the puzzle, choose to either open only black doors, or only white doors. Only open doors of the opposing colour once you've completed the room in the centre of the puzzle.

Unknowns: Each room is solvable using only the rules you've uncovered to get there - you can ignore any symbols that are unfamiliar.
