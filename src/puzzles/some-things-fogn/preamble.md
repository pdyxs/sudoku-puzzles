*Some things are fogn, and others are wrogn*

*On the heels of [Whispers in the mist](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000LUE), I had a fun idea of how yin-yang fog could be used in a wrogn puzzle. Here is that puzzle.*

*Like most wrogn puzzles, it's a bit of a grab bag of constraints, but should be fairly approachable if you're familliar with each of those constraints. Let me know how you find it!*
