{sudoku}

Counting circles: A digit N within a circle appears in circles N times.

Encroaching fog: The grid is not covered in fog. Placing a correct digit in a cell will summon fog to that cell, and to all cells surrounding that cell. Clues beneath the fog are no longer valid.

Unbounded neighbours: The fog will hide the grid lines between all pairs of cells that are consecutive within any 3x3 box.
