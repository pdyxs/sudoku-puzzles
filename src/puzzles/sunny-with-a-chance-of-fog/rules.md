{sudoku}

Counting circles: A digit N within a circle appears in circles N times.

Encroaching fog: The grid is not covered in fog. Placing a correct digit in a cell will summon fog to that cell, and in some cases, other cells as well. Clues beneath the fog are no longer valid. No guessing or erasing of digits is required (though you might need to erase pencilmarks).

Grid-line Kropki: If two cells do not have a grid line between them, their digits are consecutive.

Note: The colour tool will not work, and the line tool is strange. Such is the price of summoning fog!
