Sudoku: Fill the grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Yin Yang Fog: The grid is covered in fog. Once the puzzle is completed, any unshaded cells will be revealed, and shaded cells will still be covered in fog. All shaded cells are orthogonally connected, all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected and no 2x2 region is entirely shaded or entirely unshaded.

Clearing Fog: Entering the correct digit in an unshaded cell will clear the fog in that cell, and in any adjacent unshaded cells.

Some Things Wrogn: Clues that are in unshaded cells are wrogn - that is, they are not 100% correct. Cells connected to the same clue must either be all shaded or all unshaded. When the fog lifts on an unshaded cell, it may reveal new clues, which will also be wrogn.

Some Things Fogn: Clues that are in shaded cells are correct. Entering the correct digit into a shaded cell will reveal no fog.

Clues:
 * Kropki: Digits connected by a white dot are consecutive. When digits are connected by a black (or hollow) dot, one is double the other
 * Region Sum lines: Region boundaries separate a thick solid line into segments, each of which sum to the same number
 * German Whispers: Adjacent digits along a hollow line must differ by at least 5
 * Arrows: Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the (thicker) circle
 * Counting circles: A digit N in a circle (including the arrow circles) appears in circles exactly N times
 * A given digit has the value shown
