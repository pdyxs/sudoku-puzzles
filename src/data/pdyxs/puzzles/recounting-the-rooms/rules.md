Sudoku: Fill the grid with the digits 1-9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Kropki: A black dot between two digits means that one is double the other.

Numbered Rooms: Clues outside the grid indicate the digit which must be placed in the Nth **revealed** cell along the corresponding row or column, where N is the digit in the first **revealed** cell in that direction.

Counting Circle: A digit X in a **revealed** circle appears in **revealed** circles X times.

Dynamic Fog: The grid is covered in fog. Once all visible numbered room clues are satisfied, some of the fog will lift to reveal more cells and clues.

Unstable Rooms: The digits outside the grid are unstable - that is, they may change values when the fog clears.
