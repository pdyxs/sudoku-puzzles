1. There are 9 5-cell renbans, so each one needs a 5 and all the 5's are on renbans
1. Rows 1 and 9 and columns 1 and 9 each need a 5, so they go in c4c6 and r4r6 respectively. This means that r5c5 has to be a 5.
1. The two revealed black kropkis must be 24 and 36 to make the renbans work. R5c6 must be a 6 to allow r4c6 to be consecutive (so it is 7). r4c5 is 8 and r6c6 is 3
1. Both r3c4-6 and r4-6c7 cannot include 5, and so must be either low (1-4) or high (6-9).  By eliminating candidates, r3c4-6 is either 321 or 678 (in that order).
1. If r4-6c7 is high, it must be 678, since r4c7 has a black kropki relationship with r3c8 (and so can't be 9). But if r4c7 is 6, r3c8 must be 3, and there is no longer a valid fill for the renban (since r3c6 is 1 or 8). This makes r4-6c7 low, and r3c4-6 321.
1. There's now a 19 pair remaining in r6c4-5, meaning that r46c7 is a 24 pair, and r5c7 is a 3
1. Because of the black kropki going into r3c8, that cell cannot be a 5. As a result you can fill in the 5's in b1, b3, b7 and b9
1. r3c8 can only be a 4, leaving r4c7 as 2 and r2c8 as 3, which unravels the 24 pair in box 5. r5c9 must be a 1 to leave room for the renban in box 6
1. The renban in b9 can't have a 3 on it, so must be 45678. The 8 can be placed in r7c6
1. The renban in b1 needs a 4, which must be in r2c23. This means that 4 in b2 is in r1c56.
1. r12c6 can only be 4, 5 or 9. Because 4 and 9 can't both be on the renban, the 5 must be in r1c6. This places a 4 in r1c5, a 9 in r2c6 and a 5 in r9c4
1. The renban contained in b8 now contains a 24 pair (in r89c6), and so needs a 3, which must be in r8c5
1. There's a 3 in r4c12 (since it can't repeat on the renban in b1), meaning that the renban contained in b4 needs a 4. This can only be in r5c2, and sets the 4 in b1.
1. The revealed black kropki means that r6c1 must be a 2. This finishes the remaining 5's and the 3 in b4. r6c2 must be a 6 to finish the renban
1. r4c3 must now be a 1, and its renban can now be finished
1. r6c3 is 7 or 8, meaning its renban needs a 6, which can only be in r7c4
1. The white kropki in r78c2 must include an 8, setting r6c3 to 7. The white kropki in r56c3 means that r5c3 is 8.
1. The remainder of the puzzle can now be filled in using sudoku
