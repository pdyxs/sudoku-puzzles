To start, you need to know these rules:
* {sudoku}
* Renban Lines: Digits on a line form a set of non-repeating, consecutive digits in any order.

Later, you'll need to know these as well:
* Encroaching fog: The grid is not covered in fog. Placing a correct digit in a cell will summon fog to that cell, and to the 8 surrounding cells. No guessing or erasing of digits is required.
* Kropki: If two cells do not have a grid line between them, their digits are consecutive. If a line is hollow between two cells, the digit in one cell is double the other. Not all kropki clues are given.

Notes: 
* In this puzzle, constraints are being rendered in non-standard ways.
* The colour tool will not work, and the line tool is strange. Such is the price of summoning fog!
