*I've always loved time travel stories, and "This is how you lose the Time War" is one of my favourites. This puzzle is my attempt at an adaptation.*

*If you haven't already, I recommend that you first play [This is how you learn the Time War](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000M6F), to familiarise yourself with the rules.*

*As always, let me know what you think!*
