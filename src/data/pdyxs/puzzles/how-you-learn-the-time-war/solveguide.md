1. Because there must be a 2 in c1 (and that number is both where blue is and representing blue's age in the row), Blue's age in c1 must be 2. This means that in c23 blue must be 1 or 3 (as they can only jump up to 2 columns for each change of age). c45 can be 4, 5 or 6, but c6 can only be 5 or 6 (so that 4 is within 2 columns of 3)
1. Similarly, Red must be 5 in c6, and must be 4 or 6 in c45. c23 can be 1,2, or 3, and c1 can be 1 or 2
1. The 17 clue in c6 leaves only 4 left for the column. None of this can be claimed by blue (since it would require another 2) or red (since it must claim at least 5). This means that r1c6 is 1, 3 or 4. But if r12c6 was a 12 pair, then both 5's in r12 would be in box 1 (since Red is ages 1 and 3 in c123). So r1c6 is 4, and r1c45 is 5
1. The 19 clue in c2 means that the whole column has a block of 2, and a block of 19. The block of 2 must be the 2, and so the 2 must appear at either the very top or the very bottom of the column. The 5 must appear in r12c2, but because of the previous step, cannot be in r1. So r2c2 is 5 and r1c2 is 2.
1. Because Red must take control from Blue in c2 (to get a sum of 19), Red's age must be greater than Blue's. This means that Blue's age (r1c1) must be 1 and Red's age (r2c6) must be 2 or 3
1. But r2c6 must be 2 or 5 to make the 17 clue work, and so must be a 2. This in turn means that r2c1 must be 6 (as Blue's age must be 5 or 6, but 5 is already used in the row)
1. Red in c4 must win exactly 1 cell (the 5), since either Red or blue will have a sum of above 5. Both 2 and 5 must be within r4-6c4, and r1-3c4 are unclaimed
1. Neither r12c3 can be claimed as there is already a 2 and 5 in the box.
1. This leaves only r1c5 as a place for 5, and set's Red's age to be 4 in c5. Therefore Red is age 6 is c4, and 3 in c3 (so that it can reach the 4 within 2 columns). This resolves the rest of Red's ages,
1. The rest of r12 can be filled in using sudoku, leaving a 13 pair in r2c45
1. Red now has an age of 6 in c4, so must be at the bottom of that column (setting r6c4 to 5 and r6c6 to 6)
1. In c5, Blue's age must be higher than Red's, so Blue's age is 5 here, and 4 in c4.
1. As both Red and Blue are age 3 in c3, whoever appears in the column first controls the rest of the column, and 5 and 2 are claimed by the same colour. As such, the 8 must be made up of 125 in some order in r4-6c3, with the 1 being in b5.
1. This leaves r3c3 as 6, and the rest of the 6's can be filled in.
1. As all cells in c5 are claimed, it must be split into a block of 13 and a block of 8. The only way to make a block of 8 with 2 is a 26 pair, but 6 is in r4c5, and is too high up the column for that to work. So Red has the block of 8 at the top of the column, which must be 53 (since 512 would include a 2 and thus flip control)
1. Now 2 is in r3c5, which sets r3c1 to 5. 2 can now be placed in r5c4, and r5c1 is therefore 4.
1. From here, the rest of the puzzle can be solved using sudoku.
