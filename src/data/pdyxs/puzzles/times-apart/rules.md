Space-Time: Each row of the grid represents a slice of time, with the top row as the earliest and the bottom row as the latest. Each column of the grid represents a different location in space.

Timelines: Two time travelling friends, 2 and 5, are jumping forwards and backwards through space-time. The marked columns each represent an traveller's timeline - each digit in the column shows the traveller's age when they appear in that row. The rows below the grid can be used to keep track of each traveller's age in each column, and are not a part of the solution.

Time Jumps: When jumping from one cell to the next (ie. when their age increases by 1), a time traveller may travel as much as they like in time, but only up to 2 columns in space. For example, if a traveller at age 3 is in column 2, their digit must appear in columns 1, 3 or 4 in the row where they are age 4.

Time Sandwiches: Digits outside the grid indicate the sum of the digits that are placed in-between the 2 and 5 in that row or column.
