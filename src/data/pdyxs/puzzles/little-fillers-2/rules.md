Sudoku: Fill the grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Renban: A purple line contains a set of non-repeating consecutive digits in any order.

Sandwich: Clues outside the grid show the sum of the digits between the 1 and 9 in that row or column

Little Killer: Clues outside the grid with an arrow ALSO show the sum of the digits on the indicated diagonal

Blank Clues: A box indicates that the Little Killer and Sandwich clues here have the same value, to be determined by the solver. Each box can have a different value.
