Sudoku: Fill the grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Yin Yang Fog: The grid is covered in fog. Once the puzzle is completed, any unshaded cells will be revealed, and shaded cells will still be covered in fog. All shaded cells are orthogonally connected, all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected and no 2x2 region is entirely shaded or entirely unshaded.

Clearing Fog: Entering a correct digit in an unshaded cell will clear the fog in that cell, as well as in any unshaded cells that can be seen (either partially or fully) from the centre of that cell in any direction (with shaded cells blocking vision)

Unshaded Whispers: Any two orthogonally connected unshaded cells must have a difference of at least 5.

Kropki: A white dot separates digits which are consecutive.

Given Digits: White given digits need to be entered into the grid.
