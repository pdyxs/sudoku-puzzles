Sudoku: Fill the grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each digit occurs exactly once in every row, every column and every 3x3 box.

Yin Yang Fog: The grid is covered in fog. Once the puzzle is completed, any unshaded cells will be revealed, and shaded cells will still be covered in fog. All shaded cells are orthogonally connected, all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected and no 2x2 region is entirely shaded or entirely unshaded.

Clearing Fog: Entering a correct digit in an unshaded cell will clear the fog in that cell, and in all unshaded cells that can be seen from that cell in an orthogonal direction (with shaded cells blocking vision).

German Whispers: Digits in cells connected by a green line must have a difference of at least 5. All unshaded cells are part of a single, connected German Whispers line, and no shaded cells are. The German Whispers line only connects cells orthogonally.

Kropki: A white dot separates digits which are consecutive.

Given Digits: White given digits need to be entered into the grid.
