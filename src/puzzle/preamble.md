*This is a continuation of the concepts I started to explore in [The Grid of Forking Paths](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000LE5). In this puzzle, how much fog you have (and therefore how hard the puzzle is) is entirely up to you! The more doors you open, the easier it'll be to solve. I'd love to know how people approach this one, so if you can comment with the doors you opened it'd be much appreciated.*
